<h1> COP3530 - Project 3 - YouTube Roulette </h1>

The website gets user data and displays a random YouTube video guided by the user's inputs. The user needs to input a written genre, selects a time range and checks off if they want the video to be from safe search (kid friendly). 
After pressing the "Feeling Lucky?" button, the website will display confetti and will embed or will change the current embedded video to a new YouTube video.
In order for someone to use this website, they need to access the source code, specifically api.js, In this code they need to change the variable "apiKey" to a real API key.
This API key can be obtained through Google's Developers Console, https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard. After putting a real key, the website can be used about 70 times per day.
